# External-Roblox-ESP
This is an external ESP for Roblox. It was made while I was learning to reverse Roblox's structures. This is just a base so it doesn't do anything fancy. Please ignore the ugly code.


Constains:
- [X] Toggleable GUI.
- [X] Resizing Overlay.
- [X] Memory Reading Class.
- [X] Box ESP.
- [X] Name ESP.
- [X] Terrible Code.
